Based on the work of ninjakakes and Super Junkoid for Archipelago<br>
So far I've been putting all this in a folder called "cliffredux" in the "worlds" folder of Archipelago 0.4.5<br>
<br>
Apr 4, 2024 noontime it currently will authenticate the world, create an AP world which I can host on the site<br>
I can connect to the world and patch the rom to open SNIClient<br>
From there, the rom runs up to the intro and goes to a black screen instead of the landing site<br>
I suspect there is a patch in the romwriter for Super Junkoid that is interfering<br>
SNI/SNIClient will also not connect to my rom. I suspect something is fishy with data/ap_cliff_redux_patch/sm-basepatch-symbols.json<br>
<br>
Welcoming help and feedback, work in progress
